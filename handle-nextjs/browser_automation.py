        I need you to fill out a job application form intelligently. Here's what you need to do:

        1. Navigate to this job application URL: {job_url}
        
        2. Look at the page and identify all form fields that need to be filled
        
        3. Fill out the form with the following information:
           - Name: {user_data.get('firstName', '')} {user_data.get('lastName', '')}
           - Email: {user_data.get('email', '')}
           - Phone: {user_data.get('phone', '')}
           
        4. For any text areas or essay questions, use this background information to write personalized responses:
           {user_data.get('backgroundInfo', 'I am a motivated professional looking for new opportunities.')}
           
        5. For any questions about why you want to work there, motivation, or cover letter, create a personalized response based on:
           - The company name and job title you can see on the page
           - The background information provided above
           - Make it sound professional and enthusiastic
           
        6. Skip any file upload fields (resume, portfolio, etc.) - just leave them empty
        
        7. Do NOT submit the form - just fill it out and leave it for the user to review
        
        8. Take your time to understand each field before filling it
        
        9. If you encounter any errors or can't find certain fields, continue with the ones you can fill
        
        Please be thorough and intelligent about understanding what each field is asking for based on its label, placeholder text, or surrounding context.
